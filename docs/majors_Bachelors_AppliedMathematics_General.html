<p>A program that focuses on the application of mathematics to the
solution of functional problems in fields such as engineering and the
applied sciences. Includes instruction in natural phenomena modeling
continuum mechanics, reaction-diffusion, wave propagation, dynamic
systems, numerical analysis, controlled theory, asymptotic methods,
variation, optimization theory, inverse problems, and applications to
specific scientific and industrial topics.</p>
