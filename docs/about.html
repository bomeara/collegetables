<h2>About</h2>
<p>This was done over a break in summer 2022 while starting to take my
kids on college visits, then updated over winter break 2022-3 and
tweaked to update with new data; as I mention on the home page, while
there are lots of “College Ranking” websites, they use some odd factors
to rank (such as college administrators ranking each other, standardized
testing scores, how many students they reject, and more for <a
href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/ranking-criteria-and-weights">US
News and World Report</a>) while omitting things like tenure track
faculty numbers, library resources, climate, and whether the state safe
for LGBTQ+ students. The US federal data have information on lots of
schools: I chose to present info on all the schools that are still open
rather than filter for the schools just of interest to my family (my
kids are not going to seminary for a Masters degree or to a school for
funeral service directors any time soon, but this might be of interest
to students, staff, or faculty considering those schools, so I am
including them). Some schools, especially smaller ones (some have just a
few dozen students) do not include all information and so these school
pages might be sparse.</p>

an article</a> featuring this site and others that may be helpful for
you.</p>
<p><strong>If you have feedback on the site (corrections, good data
sources, etc.) please go <a
href="https://forms.gle/C9D7WXaMDVrTm3Z3A">here</a> (and thank
you!).</strong></p>
<p>There are two main types of pages on this site: one page for each
institution (over 9,000 of them) and pages of degrees offered by various
groupings of schools.</p>
<ul>
<li>The institutions have their individual data as well as comparisons
with “similar” schools, where similar is based on athletic conference
(for example, small liberal arts schools in Western Massachusetts), the
type of the school (i.e., is it a research intensive doctoral
institution). For metrics where one direction is better (lower cost is
good; more faculty is good) there is a ranking versus schools in the
comparison group. There are also line plots showing trends over time. If
a trend is “significant” (i.e., it is not likely to be due to random
chance, as assessed by fitting a linear model (and not correcting for
multiple comparisons)) then there is a column indicating the slope of
the trend.</li>
<li>The degrees pages show degrees awarded in different fields in the
most recent year available. There are many, many specific majors, so the
main groups are listed at [fields_overview.html] and you can then drill
down into the subfields.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="changes" class="section level2">
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>May 20, 2023: Updated with latest information on abortion,
legislative risk, and some changes in Missouri and Florida. Added
information on distance to mountains. Also added information on life
expectancy by state (hopefully not relevant to undergrads, but perhaps
of note to faculty and staff).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="details-of-the-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2>Details of the metrics</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Acceptance</strong>: Percentage of undergraduate
applicants who are offered admission.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Yield</strong>: Percentage of people who, upon receiving
the offer of admission, choose to attend.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>First year retention</strong>: Percentage of
undergraduates who re-enroll in their second year. This can indicate
they adequately like the school and are receiving support they need to
be successful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transfer</strong>: Percentage of students who transfer
out from their bachelors program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graduation</strong>: Percentage of undergraduates who
graduate with a degree. Note that not all students enter an instiution
with this intent: someone could take a welding class at a community
college just to learn the skill without intending to get a degree in it.
That said, higher graduation rate is typically a good thing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undergrad enrollment</strong>: The number of
undergraduate students (typically those seeking an associates or
bachelors degree).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graduate enrollment</strong>: The number of students
enrolled seeking a masters, PhD, or similar degree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Degrees (of various kinds) awarded</strong>: How many
students got each degree from this college in a single year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undergrads per instructor</strong>: Undergraduate
enrollment divided by number of instructors. This does not mean the
typical class size: some instructors might teach four classes, others
just one; one class may have 300 students, and most others have just 10.
But generally one wants a lower number so that students have more access
to instructors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undergrads per tenure-track professor</strong>:
Undergraduate enrollment divided by the number of faculty on the tenure
track (both tenured and pre-tenure). Tenure helps protect academic
freedom: someone with tenure can be fired if they do not fulfill their
duties, commit misconduct, and so forth, but they cannot (easily) be
fired because the content of what they teach disagrees with what their
boss thinks, their research topic annoys a major donor, and so forth. A
lower number is better; the exceptions may be institutions where skilled
professionals who practice a subject (a musician, an actor, a painter,
and so forth) comes in to teach for a semester or a few years but with
the intent for it to be short term.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Average net price for students with
grants/scholarships</strong>: This uses federal data for what students
who are getting some sort of grant or scholarship pay <em>on
average</em>. There can be <em>huge variation</em> in this: some schools
charge far less for in-state than out-of-state students, some with large
endowments might charge students from less wealthy families nothing but
charge a lot to others, etc. It is possible that an Ivy league private
university could be cheaper for some students than their local
government-supported college (but far more expensive for other
students), but the average price does not reflect this. Thus, this may
be among the least useful items of information since it will not do a
good job predicting what your family will pay. This is only reported for
colleges that accept some federal support for students. Federal support
comes with various requirements (prohibition of some kinds of
discrimination, guidelines about handling of some kinds of alleged
misconduct, and more), so a handful of colleges reject all federal
support so they are not subject to one or more of these requirements. I
have included a comparison to Harvard, not because Harvard is
particularly expensive (its large endowment lets it award a substantial
amount of aid) but to help people realize that sticker price is not the
same as actual cost of attendance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tuition and fees</strong> as a source of core revenues:
What percentage of revenue comes from charging students. If an
institution relies substantially on this, it can have problems if
enrollment drops (it has fixed costs spread across fewer students, so it
has to make cuts, and so it may attract fewer students…).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investment return</strong>: Percentage of income from
investments (stocks, bonds, and so forth). Provides a buffer, but not
all institutions have had wealth to build upon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State/Local appropriations</strong>: States, counties,
cities may choose to invest in their residents by supporting
institutions (more educated workforce, more practical skills, more
understanding of our world and its history, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Government grants and contracts</strong>: Faculty often
compete to get resources to support their work: a federal grant to study
the effect of wildfire on deer numbers, a state grant to develop new
algorithms to make self-driving cars more efficient, and so forth. These
can pay for staff, support students, buy materials, cover travel, and
more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Private gifts, grants, and contracts</strong>: As above,
but also just donations of money or other gifts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Location</strong>: Various location statistics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee/Student covid vax</strong>: At some point during
the pandemic did the institution enforce a mandate that employees and/or
students get vaccinated for covid? Note that regardless of whether an
institution required it, anyone may still seek a vaccine: <a
href="https://www.vaccines.gov/"
class="uri">https://www.vaccines.gov/</a>. There may be other mitigation
measures as well (masking, distancing, pivoting to remote instruction)
but there are no available datasets on these. This is based on reporting
by <a
href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/live-coronavirus-updates/heres-a-list-of-colleges-that-will-require-students-to-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19">Andy
Thomason and Brian O’Leary in the <em>Chronicle of Higher
Education</em></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abortion</strong>: Is abortion legal in this
institution’s state? In 2022, the US Supreme Court <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women">ruled</a>
that there was no right to abortion in the United States, leaving it to
each state individually to decide on whether and how to regulate this.
Some states had laws on the books regulating it, others quickly moved to
pass new laws or constitutional amendments. There may also be lawsuits
that prevent enforcement of some of these laws. Thus, the situation may
change quickly over the next few months to years. Also, this site uses a
very coarse measure of whether abortions are permitted or restricted;
there is a lot of nuance (is it allowed only up to some week of
pregnancy, what about to save the life of the pregnant parent, are there
restrictions on leaving the state to seek an abortion) that is not
captured by this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gun law stringency</strong>: A better grade indicates
more stringent laws, based on assessments by the <a
href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/resources/scorecard/">Giffords Law
Center to Prevent Gun Violence</a> as of Aug. 8, 2022. People who want
to prioritize states with laxer gun laws should look for states with
<em>lower</em> grades. Note that these are about policies at the
<em>state</em> level: counties or cities may have their own laws, and
institutions may create their own policies as well (for example, guns
may be banned in student housing).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State rep support for legal contraception / same-sex and
interracial marriages</strong>: In the same ruling that overturned the
Roe v. Wade precedent and thus allowed state bans of abortion, there was
some discussion of overturning other precedents, such as the ones
allowing same sex marriage or contraception. It is hard to predict what
will happen in this area, but it may be relevant to people deciding
where to be for the next several years. As an estimate of the support
leaders have for these policies, the percentage of each state’s
delegation in the US House that voted for <a
href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8404">US
House Resolution 8404</a> (protecting same-sex and interracial marriage)
and <a
href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8373">US
House Resolution 8373</a> (protecting the right to contraception) is now
displayed. It is not a guarantee of how states will decide on these
policies if it becomes a state matter, but it is at least an
estimate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diversity among the faculty or students</strong>: This
uses data provided by the institutions, which is almost certainly based
on individuals’ self-reporting. The federal data only allows the given
racial/ethnic categories and only man or woman for gender. Most other
axes of diversity are not readily available. Note that people who are
not residents of the US fall into the “non-resident alien” for
race/ethnicity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notes</strong>: Individual institution pages may display
a note at the top of the page triggered by various conditions. They
contain explanatory notes when they appear, but so far include: 1)
institutions in states where <a
href="https://oag.ca.gov/ab1887">California has decided there
discriminatory laws</a> and so bans state-sponsored travel; 2)
institutions whose administrations are currently <a
href="https://www.aaup.org/issues/academic-freedom/whatiscensure">censured
by the American Association of University Professors</a>; 3)
institutions that have over a thousand students for every tenure-track
faculty member (usually this means there are zero tenure-track
faculty).</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="main-sources-for-information" class="section level2">
<h2>Main sources for information</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data">National Center for
Education Statistics IPEDS</a>: Source of much of the data on
enrollment, composition of the student body and faculty, income sources,
and more. Data come from mostly 2019-2020 (before the worst effects of
the pandemic hit). Some data may have changed rapidly (reorganizing
athletic conferences has become popular, for example).</li>
<li>Walkability comes from <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping">US EPA
data</a>: I’ve rescaled it so that 76-100% is most walkable, 52-76% is
above average walkable, 29-52% is below average walkable, and 0-29% is
least walkable.</li>
<li>Anti-LGBTQ+ laws come from assessments made under <a
href="https://oag.ca.gov/ab1887">California bill 1887</a>, as of July
31, 2022, which requires the California Attorney General to determine
which states have laws that support discrimination against against
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and bans state-sponsored
travel to those states. Note that this is a property of the state an
institution is in, not any policies of the institution itself.</li>
<li>Abortion restrictions come from assessments from the <a
href="https://states.guttmacher.org/policies/">Guttmacher Institute</a>
as of May 10, 2023. This may change quickly.</li>
<li>Anti-Trans legislative risk comes from <a
href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/june-anti-trans-legislative-risk">Erin
Reed</a> as of June 25, 2023. This is another area changing
quickly.</li>
<li>Gun law strictness comes from the <a
href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/resources/scorecard/">Giffords Law
Center to Prevent Gun Violence</a> as of Aug. 8, 2022.</li>
<li>Campus misconduct information comes from the <a
href="https://ope.ed.gov/campussafety/#/">US Department of Education’s
Campus Safety and Security</a> report. This includes data from all
institutions that receive US Title IV funding, which includes most
instititutions. These numbers are almost certainly a gross
underestimate: see <a href="https://www.rainn.org/">RAINN</a> to learn
more.</li>
<li>Covid vaccination requirements for students and employees comes from
a <a
href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/live-coronavirus-updates/heres-a-list-of-colleges-that-will-require-students-to-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19">database
compiled by Andy Thomason and Brian O’Leary for <em>The Chronicle of
Higher Education</em></a>. Hopefully covid is waning, but it is a good
indicator of whether a school will do a fairly basic step to keep their
communities safe. Note that this field is based on text matching between
a school name in IPEDS data and a school name in their database. It is
also possible that a small school is missing from their database.</li>
<li>Information on censure of a university or university system’s
administration comes from the <a href="https://www.aaup.org/">American
Association of University Professors</a>, which will remove the censure
once the problematic conditions are resolved.</li>
