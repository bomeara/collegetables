<h1 class="title toc-ignore">About</h1>

</div>


<div id="about" class="section level3">
<h3>About</h3>
<p>This was done over a break in summer 2022 while starting to take my
kids on college visits; as I mention on the home page, while there are
lots of “College Ranking” websites, they use some odd factors to rank
(such as college administrators ranking each other, standardized testing
scores, how many students they reject, and more for <a
href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/ranking-criteria-and-weights">US
News and World Report</a>) while omitting things like tenure track
faculty numbers, library resources, climate, and whether the state safe
for LGBTQ+ students.</p>
<p><strong>If you have feedback on the site (corrections, good data
sources, etc.) please go <a
href="https://forms.gle/C9D7WXaMDVrTm3Z3A">here</a> (and thank
you!).</strong></p>
<p>There are three main types of pages on this site: one page for each
institution (over 3,000 of them), one page for each state, and pages of
degrees offered by various groupings of schools.</p>
<ul>
<li>The institutions have their individual data as well as comparisons
with “similar” schools, where similar is based on athletic conference
(for example, small liberal arts schools in Western Massachusetts), the
type of the school (i.e., is it a research intensive doctoral
institution), and the general category (4-year for-profit, for example).
The bars show where this school places relative to others
(<em>higher</em> is further to the right). “Better” is more purple: it’s
better to have more books per student, but also better to have fewer
arrests per student, and the color adjusts automatically for this.</li>
<li>The state pages show where students from each state go to college as
freshmen. Note that some colleges do not report information on the
states of origin of their students; some of these are large state
schools, and it is likely that many of their students come from their
home state and are not counted. The state pages might help decide on
schools to consider: there are over 3,000 schools but some may serve
only local populations and there may be a closer equivalent. It can also
highlight other schools that others have found compelling – for example,
one of the most popular schools for students from Arizona is a community
college in California.</li>
<li>The degrees pages use a treemap to show the number of degrees
offered by differing groupings of schools. The pages are very large, and
so they may take several seconds to load. It can be an interesting way
to understand relative importance of schools in regards to who is giving
degrees: for example, <a
href="https://collegetables.info/WesternGovernorsUniversity.html">Western
Governors University</a> awards 24,676 bachelors degrees a year, which
is 1.5 times the total number of bachelors degrees awarded by all the
Ivy League (Brown, U Penn, Princeton, and others). Note that awarding
degrees (and the education of people required to do this) is
<strong>not</strong> the only purpose of many institutions: major parts
include research, other creative work, and service. Discovering new
species, creating models for economies, helping farmers fight new
invasive weeds are important efforts of colleges and universities that
do not show up in the number of degrees – that is just one easy to
compute metric.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="details-of-the-metrics" class="section level3">
<h3>Details of the metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Acceptance</strong>: Percentage of undergraduate
applicants who are offered admission</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Yield</strong>: Percentage of people who, upon receiving
the offer of admission, choose to attend</p></li>
<li><p><strong>First year retention</strong>: Percentage of
undergraduates who re-enroll in their second year. This can indicate
they adequately like the school and are receiving support they need to
be successful</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graduation</strong>: Percentage of undergraduates who
graduate with a degree. Note that not all students enter an instiution
with this intent: someone could take a welding class at a community
college just to learn the skill without intending to get a degree in it.
That said, higher graduation rate is typically a good thing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undergrad enrollment</strong>: The number of
undergraduate students (typically those seeking an associates or
bachelors degree).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graduate enrollment</strong>: The number of students
enrolled seeking a masters, PhD, or similar degree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Degrees (of various kinds) awarded</strong>: How many
students got each degree from this college in a single year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undergrads per instructor</strong>: Undergraduate
enrollment divided by number of instructors. This does not mean the
typical class size: some instructors might teach four classes, others
just one; one class may have 300 students, and most others have just 10.
But generally one wants a lower number so that students have more access
to instructors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undergrads per tenure-track professor</strong>:
Undergraduate enrollment divided by the number of faculty on the tenure
track (both tenured and pre-tenure). Tenure helps protect academic
freedom: someone with tenure can be fired if they do not fulfill their
duties, commit misconduct, and so forth, but they cannot (easily) be
fired because the content of what they teach disagrees with what their
boss thinks, their research topic annoys a major donor, and so forth. A
lower number is better; the exceptions may be institutions where skilled
professionals who practice a subject (a musician, an actor, a painter,
and so forth) comes in to teach for a semester or a few years but with
the intent for it to be short term.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Average net price for students with
grants/scholarships</strong>: This uses federal data for what students
who are getting some sort of grant or scholarship pay <em>on
average</em>. There can be <em>huge variation</em> in this: some schools
charge far less for in-state than out-of-state students, some with large
endowments might charge students from less wealthy families nothing but
charge a lot to others, etc. It is possible that an Ivy league private
university could be cheaper for some students than their local
government-supported college (but far more expensive for other
students), but the average price does not reflect this. Thus, this may
be among the least useful items of information since it will not do a
good job predicting what your family will pay. This is only reported for
colleges that accept some federal support for students. Federal support
comes with various requirements (prohibition of some kinds of
discrimination, guidelines about handling of some kinds of alleged
misconduct, and more), so a handful of colleges reject all federal
support so they are not subject to one or more of these
requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Endowment assets per FTE</strong>: Endowments are
financial assets colleges can use for various expenses (due to interest,
returns on investments, and similar). See more detail <a
href="http://collegeaffordability.urban.org/cost-of-educating/endowments/">here</a>.
They can be used for everything from grants to make college cheaper for
students to private jet flights for a coach. They also help buffer an
institution against a sudden cost or loss of revenue (colleges with
small endowments and with revenue entirely from tuition may close if
enrollment drops). This is the total value of the endowment divided by
the number of full time students. Note that endowments are not a giant
pot of money to use as an institution wishes: they are often many small
pots of money dedicated to particular areas (“this money can only be
used to support research on woodpeckers in Ohio”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equity ratio</strong>: This is a measure of an
institution’s ability to borrow (another way to ride out bad times).
Higher is generally better.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tuition and fees</strong> as a source of core revenues:
What percentage of revenue comes from charging students. If an
institution relies substantially on this, it can have problems if
enrollment drops (it has fixed costs spread across fewer students, so it
has to make cuts, and so it may attract fewer students…).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investment return</strong>: Percentage of income from
investments (stocks, bonds, and so forth). Provides a buffer, but not
all institutions have had wealth to build upon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State/Local appropriations</strong>: States, counties,
cities may choose to invest in their residents by supporting
institutions (more educated workforce, more practical skills, more
understanding of our world and its history, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Government grants and contracts</strong>: Faculty often
compete to get resources to support their work: a federal grant to study
the effect of wildfire on deer numbers, a state grant to develop new
algorithms to make self-driving cars more efficient, and so forth. These
can pay for staff, support students, buy materials, cover travel, and
more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Private gifts, grants, and contracts</strong>: As above,
but also just donations of money or other gifts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Misconduct of various kinds</strong>: These are incidents
or arrests occurring on campus (they do not necessarily involve
students, however). To normalize the numbers, it is the average over
three years weighted by the number of students. Institutions are
required to report this information to the federal government, but
students are not (usually) required to report incidents to their
institution, and there are many reasons why individuals choose not to
trust an institution with these data. See <a
href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence">RAINN</a>
for more information on this. Individual institutions may also publish
more details on this (look for “Title IX transparency report” and “Clery
Act reporting” or similar).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Library number of…</strong>: The number of physical
books, other objects, and digital materials that all the libraries have
at this institution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Total library circulations</strong>: How many loans were
made of the above materials</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Average loans per student or faculty member</strong>:
Dividing the number of loans of physical or physical and digital
materials by the number of undergraduates, graduate students, and
faculty. This omits many important people in a university community:
postdoctoral scholars may borrow materials, typically so may any of the
other employees, there may be academic visitors with library privileges,
and so forth, but this is a way of normalizing by the overall size of an
institution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Location</strong>: Various location statistics. Note that
distance to mass transit is based on the closest part of the campus to
mass transit – it could be a very far walk from some other parts of
campus.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reported misconduct</strong>: This matches an
institution’s name to the <a
href="https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org/">Academic Sexual
Misconduct Database</a>, which includes public informaton on sexual
misconduct only. This is just the tip of a very large iceberg: those
incidents that happened, that were reported, that were investigated,
that a finding was reached, that the media could learn of, and which was
reported to this database. And it’s still over 1,200 reports so far.
Since it is based on a text search (rather than institution ID number)
there could be false matches or false lack of matches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee/Student covid vax</strong>: At some point during
the pandemic did the institution enforce a mandate that employees and/or
students get vaccinated for covid? Note that regardless of whether an
institution required it, anyone may still seek a vaccine: <a
href="https://www.vaccines.gov/"
class="uri">https://www.vaccines.gov/</a>. There may be other mitigation
measures as well (masking, distancing, pivoting to remote instruction)
but there are no available datasets on these.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abortion</strong>: Is abortion legal in this
institution’s state? In 2022, the US Supreme Court <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women">ruled</a>
that there was no right to abortion in the United States, leaving it to
each state individually to decide on whether and how to regulate this.
Some states had laws on the books regulating it, others quickly moved to
pass new laws or constitutional amendments. There may also be lawsuits
that prevent enforcement of some of these laws. Thus, the situation may
change quickly over the next few months to years. Also, this site uses a
very coarse measure of whether abortions are permitted or restricted;
there is a lot of nuance (is it allowed only up to some week of
pregnancy, what about to save the life of the pregnant parent, are there
restrictions on leaving the state to seek an abortion) that is not
captured by this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gun law stringency</strong>: A better grade indicates
more stringent laws, based on assessments by the <a
href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/resources/scorecard/">Giffords Law
Center to Prevent Gun Violence</a> as of Aug. 8, 2022. People who want
to prioritize states with laxer gun laws should look for states with
<em>lower</em> grades. Note that these are about policies at the
<em>state</em> level: counties or cities may have their own laws, and
institutions may create their own policies as well (for example, guns
may be banned in student housing).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State rep support for legal contraception / same-sex and
interracial marriages</strong>: In the same ruling that overturned the
Roe v. Wade precedent and thus allowed state bans of abortion, there was
some discussion of overturning other precedents, such as the ones
allowing same sex marriage or contraception. It is hard to predict what
will happen in this area, but it may be relevant to people deciding
where to be for the next several years. As an estimate of the support
leaders have for these policies, the percentage of each state’s
delegation in the US House that voted for <a
href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8404">US
House Resolution 8404</a> (protecting same-sex and interracial marriage)
and <a
href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8373">US
House Resolution 8373</a> (protecting the right to contraception) is now
displayed. It is not a guarantee of how states will decide on these
policies if it becomes a state matter, but it is at least an
estimate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diversity among the faculty or students</strong>: This
uses data provided by the institutions, which is almost certainly based
on individuals’ self-reporting. The federal data only allows the given
racial/ethnic categories and only man or woman for gender. Most other
axes of diversity are not readily available. Note that people who are
not residents of the US fall into the “non-resident alien” for
race/ethnicity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notes</strong>: Individual institution pages may display
a note at the top of the page triggered by various conditions. They
contain explanatory notes when they appear, but so far are: 1)
institutions in states where <a
href="https://oag.ca.gov/ab1887">California has decided there
discriminatory laws</a> and so bans state-sponsored travel; 2)
institutions whose administrations are currently <a
href="https://www.aaup.org/issues/academic-freedom/whatiscensure">censured
by the American Association of University Professors</a>; 3)
institutions that have over a thousand students for every tenure-track
faculty member (usually this means there are zero tenure-track
faculty).</p></li>

<h3>Main sources for information</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data">National Center for
Education Statistics IPEDS</a>: Source of much of the data on
enrollment, composition of the student body and faculty, income sources,
and more. Data come from mostly 2019-2020 (before the worst effects of
the pandemic hit). Some data may have changed rapidly (reorganizing
athletic conferences has become popular, for example).</li>
<li>Walkability comes from <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping">US EPA
data</a>: I’ve rescaled it so that 76-100% is most walkable, 52-76% is
above average walkable, 29-52% is below average walkable, and 0-29% is
least walkable.</li>
<li>Anti-LGBTQ+ laws come from assessments made under <a
href="https://oag.ca.gov/ab1887">California bill 1887</a>, as of July
31, 2022, which requires the California Attorney General to determine
which states have laws that support discrimination against against
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and bans state-sponsored
travel to those states. Note that this is a property of the state an
institution is in, not any policies of the institution itself.</li>
<li>Abortion restrictions come from assessments from <a
href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/abortion-laws-by-state">World
Population in Review</a> as of Aug. 8, 2022. This may change
quickly.</li>
<li>Gun law strictness comes from the <a
href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/resources/scorecard/">Giffords Law
Center to Prevent Gun Violence</a> as of Aug. 8, 2022.</li>
<li>Campus misconduct information comes from the <a
href="https://ope.ed.gov/campussafety/#/">US Department of Education’s
Campus Safety and Security</a> report. This includes data from all
institutions that receive US Title IV funding, which includes most
instititutions. These numbers are almost certainly a gross
underestimate: see <a href="https://www.rainn.org/">RAINN</a> to learn
more.</li>
<li>Covid vaccination requirements for students and employees comes from
a <a
href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/live-coronavirus-updates/heres-a-list-of-colleges-that-will-require-students-to-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19">database
compiled by Andy Thomason and Brian O’Leary for <em>The Chronicle of
Higher Education</em></a>. Hopefully covid is waning, but it is a good
indicator of whether a school will do a fairly basic step to keep their
communities safe. Note that this field is based on text matching between
a school name in IPEDS data and a school name in their database. It is
also possible that a small school is missing from their database.</li>
<li>Similarly, the reported misconduct field comes from matching
institutions via searches to the <a
href="https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org/">Academic Sexual
Misconduct Database</a>, started by Dr. Julie Libarkin. This includes
public cases of academic sexual misconduct (which may overlap with the
misconduct on campus incidents).</li>
<li>Information on censure of a university or university system’s
administration comes from the <a href="https://www.aaup.org/">American
Association of University Professors</a>, which will remove the censure
once the problematic conditions are resolved.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html">WorldClim’s
Bioclimatic variables</a> are used for getting temperature and
precipitation.</li>
<li>Biome information comes from the <a
href="http://omap.africanmarineatlas.org/BIOSPHERE/data/note_areas_sp/Ecoregions_Ecosystems/WWF_Ecoregions/WWFecoregions.htm">World
Wildlife Fund</a> and is accessed using Alexander Zizka and Alexandre
