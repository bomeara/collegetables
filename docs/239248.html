<p><a href='https://matc.edu/'>Milwaukee Area Technical College</a> is
located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It is a public, 2-year institution.</p>
<p><em>From <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%20Milwaukee%20Area%20Technical%20College">Wikipedia</a></em>:
Milwaukee Area Technical College (or MATC) is a public two-year
vocational-technical college based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. MATC offers
day, evening, and weekend classes at campuses in downtown Milwaukee, Oak
Creek, West Allis, and Mequon. Enrollment is about 35,000. MATC offers
over a dozen accredited associate degrees, as well as well over a
hundred vocational licenses, job training certificates, and adult
enrichment courses. MATC also runs GED and HSED classes at local
community-based organizations and offers high school diplomas through
its Adult High School program.</p>
<p>One of MATC’s educational outreach programs is the operation of the
two PBS stations serving Milwaukee and southeastern Wisconsin. The
stations, WMVS channel 10 and WMVT channel 36, are known collectively as
Milwaukee PBS. In 1992, in partnership with Zenith Electronics and
AT&amp;T, Channel 10 produced the nation’s first test broadcast of a
digital television signal. In March 2000, the station became the first
in Wisconsin to begin regular broadcast of digital, high-definition
programs. MATC entered the wireless digital era in 2003, becoming the
first college in Wisconsin to provide wireless Internet service
throughout all campuses.</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>These are items that bear looking into more closely.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is insufficient data to determine whether this
institution’s total assets have tended to increase or decrease over
time.</p></li>
<li><p>There are apparently no tenure stream faculty. This can indicate
a <a href='https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure'>risk to academic
freedom</a> and thus educational quality, as faculty members
<em>may</em> be able to lose their positions because of their speech,
publications, or research findings.</p></li>
<li><p>This institution’s full-time undergraduate enrollment has tended
to decrease over time.</p></li>
<li><p>From 2010 to 2021, full time undergraduate enrollment dropped
from 6967 to 3197, a decline of 54.1%</p></li>

<h1>Student financing</h1>
<p>At many universities, almost no students pay the listed tuition and
fees (“sticker price”): instead, their financial aid package lowers this
dramatically, but how much students pay can vary substantially based on
family income and other factors. The tuition below is the average across
many students receiving aid: your family may be asked to pay less or
more than this.</p>

<h1>Tenure track faculty</h1>
<p>Tenure track faculty are those who are eligible for tenure. This
includes both pre-tenure and tenured faculty. Once faculty get tenure,
they are (generally) protected from being fired for intellectual
reasons, helping to ensure their freedom in teaching and research. They
can still lose their positions for misconduct, financial problems, not
fulfilling their duties, or other reasons. Note that this chart uses US
federal demographic data: it only has two genders and a specified set of
ethnicities and races.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-tenure-track-faculty" class="section level1">
<h1>Non-tenure track faculty</h1>
<p>Non-tenure track faculty are not eligible for tenure. Some are hired
one semester at a time, some have multi-year contracts. They typically
have a higher teaching load than tenure track faculty, leaving less time
for research or other creative endeavors. They are also easier to fire
than tenured faculty. Sometimes they are external experts (a noted
musician, a former senator) who are hired to teach some classes without
the expected permanence of a tenure-track position. Note that this chart
uses US federal demographic data: it only has two genders and a
specified set of ethnicities and races.</p>

<h1>Life expectancy</h1>
<p>This hopefully will not be relevant for potential students, but it
may be for people moving to an area longer term, such as faculty and
staff choosing where to live. This uses information from US National
Vital Statistics Reports for 2020; like much federal data, it assumes
people are male or female. For age difference from median, it is from
the median state, averaging across all genders (one consequence of this
is that the difference from the median life expectancy is almost always
negative for men).</p>
<ul>
<li>Life expectancy at birth: 80.3 years women (3.6 years over the
median), 75.2 years men (1.5 years below the median)</li>
<li>Remaining life expectancy at age 18: 62.9 years women (3.5 years
over the median), 58 years men (1.5 years below the median)</li>
<li>Remaining life expectancy at age 30: 51.4 years women (3.2 years
over the median), 46.8 years men (1.3 years below the median)</li>
<li>Remaining life expectancy at age 45: 37.3 years women (2.7 years
over the median), 33.4 years men (1.1 years below the median)</li>
<li>Remaining life expectancy at age 60: 23.9 years women (2 years over
the median), 20.9 years men (1.1 years below the median)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also plot the extra / fewer years of life expected for this
state (red) compared to other states (dark gray) at each age. Again,
this is normalized for the median state.</p>
