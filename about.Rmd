### About

This was done over a break in the summer while starting to take my kids on college visits; as I mention on the home page, while there are lots of "College Ranking" websites, they use some odd factors to rank (such as colleges ranking each other, standardized testing scores, how many students they reject, and more for [US News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/ranking-criteria-and-weights)) while omitting things like are faculty free to teach in their core areas and is the state safe for LGBTQ+ students. 

This is an aggregation of information on colleges that often isn't emphasized by other sites for comparing colleges. Some of the fields:

* Percentage of students who are admitted, who decide to come (yield), who stay after their first year, and who graduate
* Students per tenure-track professor: many universities use a mixture of contingent faculty (people on short term contracts) and people who are on the tenure track (people who, if they pass various hurdles, receive the protections of tenure, which grants academic freedom from capricous firing, though they can still be fired for cause). People in tenure track positions often (but not always) have research or other creative activities as part of their job and have a lower teaching load than contingent faculty. They also tend to be more stably employed (so can be long term mentors and letter writers) and more decently paid. Many institutions have cut costs by hiring people into contingent roles rather than investing in tenure track positions.
* Walkability comes from [US EPA data](https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping): I've rescaled it so that 76-100% is most walkable, 52-76% is above average walkable, 29-52% is below average walkable, and 0-29% is least walkable.
* Anti-LGBTQ+ laws come from assessments made under [California bill 1887](https://oag.ca.gov/ab1887), as of July 31, 2022, which requires the California Attorney General to determine which states have laws that support discrimination against against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and bans state-sponsored travel to those states. Note that this is a property of the state an institution is in, not any policies of the institution itself. 
* Abortion restrictions come from assessments from [World Population in Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/abortion-laws-by-state) as of Aug. 8, 2022.
* Gun law strictness comes from the [Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence](https://giffords.org/lawcenter/resources/scorecard/) as of Aug. 8, 2022. States that have stricter gun laws are given better grades by them. People who want to priortize states with laxer gun laws should look for states with lower grades. Note that these are about policies at the *state* level: counties or cities may have their own laws, and institutions may create their own policies as well (for example, guns may be banned in student housing).
* Books per student is based on federal data on the number of physical books in an institution's library.
* Covid vaccination requirements for students and employees comes from a [database compiled by Andy Thomason and Brian O'Leary for *The Chronicle of Higher Education*](https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/live-coronavirus-updates/heres-a-list-of-colleges-that-will-require-students-to-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19).
* There are two main tracks in academia: faculty who are given short term contracts (and often a high teaching load and lower pay) and faculty who are essentially on probation (for 3-6 years, typically) and then are given tenure or fired. For more about tenure, see [here](https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure). Tenure is a way of protecting academic freedom (tenured faculty can be fired for misconduct or if a program is closed, but not for their research or speech); the fact that it is often more stable also helps ensure that faculty will be at an institution long term to serve as mentors, letter writers, etc. Having more non-tenure-track faculty can save money (they are often paid less, and teach more), reduce public dissent (they can be fired for taking a stand unpopular with their employer), and reduce research or other creative output, including mentoring in these areas (teaching loads are often higher, and research/creative output expectations lower, for faculty in non-tenure-track positions at large universities).

Both the vaccination and misconduct information is based on linking the college names, but this may be subject to error if names are very similar between two different colleges.
