### About

This was done over a break in summer 2022 while starting to take my kids on college visits; as I mention on the home page, while there are lots of "College Ranking" websites, they use some odd factors to rank (such as colleges ranking each other, standardized testing scores, how many students they reject, and more for [US News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/ranking-criteria-and-weights)) while omitting things like library resources, climate, and whether the state safe for LGBTQ+ students. A particularly startling omission in most sites is ignoring whether instructors are tenure track or non-tenure track. Both can be excellent, but tenure track are often better paid, have their positions more stably, and are less likely to be fired for the content of their research and teaching (they can still be fired for things like misconduct, but they can't (easily) be fired for studying, say, whether a major university donor's company's pollution is problematic). This site reports both the overall student to instructor ratio and student to tenured faculty member ratio.

There are two main types of pages on this site: one page for each institution (over 3,000 of them) and one page for each state:

* The institutions have their individual data as well as comparisons with "similar" schools, where similar is based on athletic conference (for example, small liberal arts schools in Western Massachusetts), the type of the school (is it a research intensive doctoral institution), and the general category (4-year for-profit, for example). The bars show where this school places relative to others (higher is further to the right). "Better" is more purple: it's better to have more books per student, but also better to have fewer arrests per student, and the color adjusts automatically for this. 
* The state pages show where students from each state go to college. Note that some colleges do not report information on the states of origin of their students; some of these are large state schools, and it is likely that many of their students come from their home state and are not counted. The state pages might help decide on schools to consider: it could be useful to know that a given student in Arizona is over 300 times more likely to go to the University of Arizona than to Harvard. Either school may be more appropriate for different students (and for some, Harvard might be the more affordable option), but U of Arizona is clearly filling a major educational need. It can also highlight other schools that others have found compelling -- for example, one of the most popular schools for students from Arizona is a community college in California.

The main sources for information:

* [National Center for Education Statistics IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data): Source of much of the data on enrollment, composition of the student body and faculty, income sources, and more. 
* Walkability comes from [US EPA data](https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping): I've rescaled it so that 76-100% is most walkable, 52-76% is above average walkable, 29-52% is below average walkable, and 0-29% is least walkable.
* Anti-LGBTQ+ laws come from assessments made under [California bill 1887](https://oag.ca.gov/ab1887), as of July 31, 2022, which requires the California Attorney General to determine which states have laws that support discrimination against against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and bans state-sponsored travel to those states. Note that this is a property of the state an institution is in, not any policies of the institution itself. 
* Abortion restrictions come from assessments from [World Population in Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/abortion-laws-by-state) as of Aug. 8, 2022. This may change quickly.
* In the same ruling that overturned the Roe v. Wade precedent and thus allowed state bans of abortion, there was some discussion of overturning other precedents, such as the ones allowing same sex marriage or contraception. It is hard to predict what will happen in this area, but it may be relevant to people deciding where to be for the next 4+ years. As an estimate of the support leaders have for these policies, the percentage of each state's delegation in the US House that voted for [US House Resolution 8404](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8404) (protecting same-sex and interracial marriage) and [US House Resolution 8373](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8373) (protecting the right to contraception) is now displayed on the institution pages.
* Gun law strictness comes from the [Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence](https://giffords.org/lawcenter/resources/scorecard/) as of Aug. 8, 2022. States that have stricter gun laws are given better grades by them. People who want to priortize states with laxer gun laws should look for states with *lower* grades. Note that these are about policies at the *state* level: counties or cities may have their own laws, and institutions may create their own policies as well (for example, guns may be banned in student housing).
* Campus misconduct information comes from the [US Department of Education's Campus Safety and Security](https://ope.ed.gov/campussafety/#/) report. This includes data from all institutions that receive US Title IV funding, which includes most instititutions. These numbers are almost certainly a gross underestimate: see [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/) to learn more.
* Covid vaccination requirements for students and employees comes from a [database compiled by Andy Thomason and Brian O'Leary for *The Chronicle of Higher Education*](https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/live-coronavirus-updates/heres-a-list-of-colleges-that-will-require-students-to-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19). Hopefully covid is waning, but it is a good indicator of whether a school will do a fairly basic step to keep their communities safe. Note that this field is based on text matching between a school name in IPEDS data and a school name in their database. It is also possible that a small school is missing from their database.
* Similarly, the reported misconduct field comes from matching institutions via searches to the [Academic Sexual Misconduct Database](https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org/), started by Dr. Julie Libarkin. This includes public cases of academic sexual misconduct (which may overlap with the misconduct on campus incidents). 
* Information on censure of a university or university system comes from the [American Association of University Professors](https://www.aaup.org/), which will remove the censure once the problematic conditions are resolved.
* [WorldClim's Bioclimatic variables](https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html) are used for getting temperature and precipitation.
* Biome information comes from the [World Wildlife Fund](http://omap.africanmarineatlas.org/BIOSPHERE/data/note_areas_sp/Ecoregions_Ecosystems/WWF_Ecoregions/WWFecoregions.htm) and is accessed using Alexander Zizka and Alexandre Antonelli's [speciesgeocodeR](https://github.com/azizka/speciesgeocodeR) package ([TÃ¶pel et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/66/2/145/2670075)).
* Map data comes from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
