My kids are looking at colleges; this aggregates information that may be useful for them but which is harder to get from existing websites.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("_packages.R")
source("R/functions.R")
tar_load(overview)

DT::datatable(overview,rownames=FALSE, filter="top", escape=FALSE)
```
