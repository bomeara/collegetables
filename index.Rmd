## STILL A DRAFT; DO NOT USE

For deciding on which college to go to (as an undergraduate, graduate student, employee such as faculty member, or other) there are a lot of resources (especially for potential undergraduate students). For example, https://collegescorecard.ed.gov is created by the federal government and has great info on things like costs and expected income; there are various sites that use a secret sauce to rank colleges (what do guidance counselors think about them, how often is research from the college cited, etc.). However, as a parent, these all felt somewhat lacking: a focus on income after graduation seems sensible, for example, but a college that sends more of its students to high paying jobs on Wall Street isn't necessarily a better one than a college whose students make less money working on humanitarian issues. There are data that most sites ignore: are the libraries well-stocked and well-used; how much of a drinking culture does campus have; do faculty have academic freedom to do research and teach; how diverse are the faculty; how has the college valued safety during the covid pandemic? And issues of the environment a college is in matter: are there limits on the healthcare students can receive, is the state for or against LGBTQ+ rights, what's the weather like, is there mass transit available, and so forth. This site attempts to gather all this. It has one massive table below, but then you can go to a page on each college to get visualizations and more tables.

All the fields can be filtered on. For ones with a few options (Yes/No, States, Sector, Abortion, etc.) you can select from pre-computed selections; for numbers, you can filter by the upper and lower limits; for free text, you can search.
